              I am an MS in Information Management student at the University of Illinois
              Urbana-Champaign, specializing in Data Science &amp; Analytics. I work across
              machine learning, data engineering, business intelligence, and AI, with experience
              translating complex business problems into analytical solutions.
            </p>

              Previously, I worked as a Decision Analytics Associate at ZS Associates, where I
              developed forecasting, classification, segmentation, and analytics solutions for
              healthcare and life sciences clients. I currently work as a Data &amp; AI Intern at
              UIF, working across SQL, Power BI, DAX, reporting, data validation, and AI-enabled
              analytics.

            <p>
              I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, analytics, and product thinking.
